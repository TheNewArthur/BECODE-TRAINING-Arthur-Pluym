# How does the internet work?

## The internet

The internet is a wire that connects servers.

No it is not a cloud, eventhough we use that word/symbol quite a lot when we talk about internet.

[e.g. What is the cloud?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OO77HFcCUs)

Yes, it also is possible to have access to the internet without a cable -think wifi and alikes-.

### Servers

Servers are -special- computers that have direct access to the internet.

### Clients

When we access the internet, using whatever device we want, we are called clients.
Clients need an internet provider to be able to go onto the internet.

### Routers

Because there are quite some servers and clients in this world, there is need for more than exactly one wire.
All those wires are connected to eachother using routers.

### IP adress

Like we all have our own adress that locates to only one place in the world, the internet is the same.
All devices on the internet have their own IP-adress -servers, clients, servers, hubs, ...-.

## Data travel

If we want to use google.com, we make our message and the adress it has to go to.
Then we wrap add our own adress so that the return message comes back to us.
That package wil go to the nearest by router who sends it to the nearest by router on his turn after adding his adress.
This goes on until the message reaches the google.com server.

Google.com will create its response and add all the adresses that were on the initial message in reversed order.
That way the message will go the exact same route as it came.
Every router will take its own adress away so that the next destination is known.
This goes on until the response reaches the destination.
